              <p>Hello, welcome to my about me page,first things first. My name is Alexis Pelletier and i am currently leaning how to code!so far id like to say its going pretty well.The thing i reall like about coding is the ending reuslts,and be able to create different things , it also helps me stay focus and keeps me occupied.At some point in my life i plan to obtain my secuirty clearance so i can become an egineer for the NSA(National Security Agency) Now a little bit about me, i am 20yrs old, and im from texas. My first very real job was joining the Marine corps at 17 , it was a love/hate relationship but i truly learnt so many new things and opportunities! Ive always been the type of person to enjoy doing anything on the defense side(hence why i joined in the first place)which is why im learning how to code, because im hoping to ,at some point work for the NSA or a private military , that would be the ideal job for me to be able to go on security missions, unfortunately my time in the Marines was cut short by 2yrs, i am currently trying to re-enlist , but into the resvers.So I am tryig my best to fix all my paper work to that one day hopefully i can get back in!</p>
